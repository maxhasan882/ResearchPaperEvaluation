There are a lot of instances of badly worded/constructed sentences. The language of the paper should be completely revised starting from the title and ending by the conclusion.
IEEE Conference template is not strictly followed. Why double quotation in the citation? Remove it. Follow IEEE citation style. Use Mendeley desktop (a bibliography management tool https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/) to organize the reference and citation list.
Organize the figures and tables.  A little amount of text in between figures look unprofessional. It is better to place the table at beginning or end of a page. similar to the case of figures. In the text. The Figure should be Fig in the Fig. cross refference. Further, intended and spacing found inappropriate.
The contribution of this paper should be mentioned at the end of the literature review in the Introduction section.
Section V is too short. Consider to remove it and those simulation data and inputs of the considered model should be summarized in a Table.

This paper presents a newly reduced switch seven-level inverter using level shifted pulse width modulation topologies. The proposed topology requires only six switches and two voltage sources to produce seven level voltage waveforms. The main advantages of this inverter are less number of power switches and DC voltage sources, reduced cost and size, lower blocking voltage on switches. These abilities are obtained by comparing the proposed topology with the existing topologies. Level-shifted modulation technique is used to generate switching pulse. Here the performance of proposed inverter has been evaluated through Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) and Trapezoidal Pulse Width Modulation (TRPWM) topologies and compared them for proposed topology. The proposed inverter has been simulated by using MATLAB software.",0

Proposed approach uses the method based on lambda calculus for semantic parsing to derive logical forms of sentences. The questions are analyzed by collecting significant features to find out correct answers from the facts. Unlike traditional approaches this paper extends lambda calculus methodology for question analysis as well as answering. The easy to analysis methodology achieves remarkable accuracy for Yes/No questions as well as reliable correctness for other cases on the five tasks of a standard text question answering dataset.,0

Individuals with blindness are difficult to communicate effectively with their environment. They always depend on other people. Sometimes they fall into a lot of problems when walking in the road, field, marketplace, bus stand, railway station and so on. So, ensuring their safety is very important to us. Giving blind people the safety information to their environment and family members are the objective of the smart glass safety system. This paper presents an accurate and reliable real-time tracking system using global positioning system (GPS). This smart glass system will help blind people gain increased independence and freedom in the indoor and outdoor environment.

Electricity demand is gradually rising day by day. Electric power generation-mix is share sources from where electricity produces. Generation sources are significant for the country those depend on geography, demography, environment and economics. So, natural gas is large share in electricity generation mix in Bangladesh. Respectively other sources like oil, coal, hydro, renewable energy are contributed for generating electricity. In future, renewable, coal, uranium will be more in generation share. The cost of electricity depends on economic and market of country. In this paper, spatiotemporal data of electric power generation mix and cost are analyzed and revealed electricity cost of per unit varies with consumer and distribution line Voltage. The future of electric power sources is bright for renewable energy and coal and uranium are best option for the large capacity power plant in Bangladesh to satisfy electricity demand.",1

Your paper title doesn't reflect your work. It shows so many tusks. But you have done only one tusk. You have just designed an antenna. There is no data for Performance Analysis of Human Brain. The title must be matched with the theme of your research.

You said it is an implantable antenna. In that case, how you feed the RF signal to the antenna? 
What the radiation pattern represent? You just showed the pattern. Please explain them clearly.
What is the reason to introduce Table1? Everyone knows that resonance frequency changes with the change of substrate.

Based on the applications and device architectures, the atomic elements in perovskite compounds, and in the electron and hole transport layers could be different. Consequently, the defects, interfacial properties, optical absorptions etc could be changed. Thus, the series resistance, shunt resistance, short circuit current, open circuit voltage etc could be different from one structure to another. I would like to see these issues being discussed in the results and discussion sections widely in the revised version rather than just presenting a generalized demonstration.

In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to measure the heart rate from the contaminated PPG signal. In the first segment of the algorithm, combinations of PPG and acceleration signals acquired using the tri-axis accelerometer are denoised using recursive least square (RLS) filter for estimation of heart rate. Absolute criterion (AC) condition is employed to eliminate runaway error while offtrack errors are reduced employing initialization.

Please add few more literatures relevant to the presented work in Section I.
The technique of separating ROI from RONI should be clarified. It is mentioned “The ROI is found manipulating the binary image.”- please explain how the manipulation was done.
The discussion in Section III.D Temper Detection is confusing. If the authors obtained ‘hash1’ and ‘b1’ from the embedding process (as the names suggest), then the whole scheme is not useful. It is expected that, in the tamper detection process, the authors used ‘hash2’ and ‘b2’ obtained in extraction process and compared them with ‘hash3’ and ‘b3’ calculated from the watermarked ROI. Please revise the relevant discussion.

Hash value of ROI is generated using SHA-512 algorithm. Last bits of average value of each 5Ã5 mask of ROI is generated. Then, scrambled watermark; hash value of ROI and compressed last bits are embedded in specific regions of RONI. The specific regions of RONI are chosen based on the position and size of the RONI. Logistic mapping is used to increase security of the proposed technique so that one cannot just easily gain access of the information. Hash value and last bits are used for two level tamper detection. If the hash values of ROI changes, then last bits are compared to detect tampered regions. Results of experiments applied on medical images shows that the proposed method produces high quality watermarked medical images, identifies the presence of tampers inside ROI.

301,9153,"The authors have proposed an integer wavelet transform based medical image watermarking scheme for tamper detection. 

There are some confusions in the contribution of this work. The authors whether have proposed a new technique of medical image watermarking or just made a combination using IWT, Logistic Mapping, SHA-512, Run Length Encoding (RLE), and Last Mean Bits. Because the authors did not provide enough justification for combining these algorithms and how this combination can be useful for medical image watermarking.
The authors did not provide an adequate literature review. Few researchers have tried using integer wavelet transform for medical image watermarking. One of the most cited integer wavelet transform based paper is “A Semi-Fragile Lossless Digital Watermarking Scheme Based on Integer Wavelet Transform” which is not cited in this paper.
In Section III-A, the authors have mentioned “At first, a threshold pixel value is fixed based on the type of the medical image. The threshold value was used to create a binary image from the original image. The ROI is found manipulating the binary image”. There is a standard method of using morphological processing to get the ROI portions of the binary image. Please give the details of the thresholding process mentioning the threshold value to create a binary image. In addition, what kind of manipulation was done to get the ROI?
The authors are confused about the ROI and RONI portions of the medical images. In Fig 5, the authors have mentioned the grey parts as RONI portions while in Fig 7, the same grey parts became ROI portions. The authors seem to be less serious for this submission.
In Section IV, the authors mentioned “Tampered regions are made manually by making some pixels white inside ROI”. There are some standard attacks or tampering methods available to validate the watermarking technique such as JPEG compression, additive Gaussian noise, rotation, sharpness, fuzziness etc. Is this method robust to JPEG compression and additive Gaussian noise?
Some spelling mistakes need to be corrected such as: ‘os’, ‘compariosn’.

Thus the size of these images is typically huge in amount. For a specific application, these images data may usually require transmission, processing and storage resources. The data in the images are frequently correlated spatially, spectrally and temporally which give an ample opportunity to compress the images in various domains.  However, most RS data compression techniques exploit the redundancies in spectral as well as spatial dimensions. Moreover, the band reordering strategy based on similarity has become an effective preprocessing tool for the lossless compression of RS images. In this paper, a segmentation-based band reordering method has been proposed on the basis of two heuristics i.e., consecutive continuity limit of bands and continuity breakdown thresholds. The aim of this method is to increase the compression gain through finding the highly correlated segments of bands in the hyperspectral sounder data-cube for efficient coding. The performances of the proposed band reordering method are measured using CCSDS 123 lossless predictor and lossless 3D-CALIC. The experimental results show the significant improvement in compression performance by using the proposed band ordering techniques for different types of real hyperspectral sounder data (5.5%-7% using CCSDS and 4%-4.5% using 3D-CALIC).",1

Writing of the paper is too poor. there are many typos and grammatiacal mistakes. The paper should be prepared according to conference template.
The authors failed to focus on the benefit of the antenna compared to other similar kind of antenna.
 Fig. 1 creates confusion. Two separate substrate planes are shown in the figure. Besides, in the last line of the 1st column in page-2, the line is ""There is given the cross sectional view of the antenna in Fig. 1"" but it is not cross sectional view.
Operational mechanism should be explained in the paper. The effect of the 5 snap on buttons in the structure need to be discussed in the paper.
In Fig. 3, 8, and 13, S-parameter value is above 0 dB at some frequencies. But it is not possible in this case. The authors should check this issue carefully.
Plot the graphs for the short frequency range such as 2-3 GHz as the expected frequency range is 2.4-2.48 GHz.
Give y-axis label and unit for each graph.
Return loss and VSWR graphs provide same information. So use only one, either return loss graph or VSWR graph.
VSWR graphs look unusual. It is difficult to understand the VSWR performance due to very high range (0-44766). Please reduce the y-axis range. I think 0-6 range is enough.
It is necessary to study co-polarization and cross-polarization radiation pattern to evaluate the radiation performance of the antenna. I recommend to include this pattern in terms of gain.

How much are the values of W and Leff as calculated from eqn. 1 and 2? What are the equations for the slots?
There is no need to show VSWR, as the S11 exactly presents another version of VSWR.

InGaN has a tunable band gap range of 0.7 eV - 3.4 eV which can cover the total solar spectrum to convert more solar energy to electrical energy. InGaN alloy has shown high research interest due to its various characteristic such as tunable band gap, low effective electron mass, high absorption coefficient, and radiation tolerance. Though having the opportunity of high efficient stable solar cell design by this material, it is still remain challenges because of limited research of this material. The goal of this work is to investigate the prospect of back contact materials on the performance of InGaN solar cells. The simulation was conducted with different ratio of In content in InGaN with different thickness of P and N layer of the single junction solar cell. Nine different cell structures were investigated using AMPS-1D simulator to find the stable and efficient InGaN cell where Ti, Mo, Cu, Ni, Pt, Au, Co, Al, Ag  etc. were used as back contact materials and found a high conversion efficiency of 25.06%.

",19.0,Investigation and Analysis of Back Contact for A Highly Efficient InGaN Thin Film Solar Cell from Numerical Analysis,Photovoltaic cell; Renewable energy; Solar energy; InGaN; APMS 1D; Conversion efficiency.,"Recently investigated InGaN is a leading photovoltaic material that has an amazing band gap. InGaN has a tunable band gap range of 0.7 eV - 3.4 eV which can cover the total solar spectrum to convert more solar energy to electrical energy. InGaN alloy has shown high research interest due to its various characteristic such as tunable band gap, low effective electron mass, high absorption coefficient, and radiation tolerance. Though having the opportunity of high efficient stable solar cell design by this material, it is still remain challenges because of limited research of this material. The goal of this work is to investigate the prospect of back contact materials on the performance of InGaN solar cells. The simulation was conducted with different ratio of In content in InGaN with different thickness of P and N layer of the single junction solar cell. Nine different cell structures were investigated using AMPS-1D simulator to find the stable and efficient InGaN cell where Ti, Mo, Cu, Ni, Pt, Au, Co, Al, Ag  etc. were used as back contact materials and found a high conversion efficiency of 25.06%. Stability of the cell structure was also investigated that is -0.04/?C shows the high stability.",0

It seems to be far distant between Motivation and Implementation of the paper.The proposed robot is not seemed to have enough quality for navigate disabled people under dangaerous situations.It seems not to be robust against any other light sources normally equipped in the environment. It might get dark by heavy smoke surrounding when teribble fire occurs.

It seems that more detailed information about an environment of the experiment should be included.It may not be clear how the experiment can be repeated for the other researchers.For example, the reviewer cannot find exact ""red torches"" product.
The reviewer could not trace the flow chart of the robot showed in Figure 6 as the simulation would be successful.The reviewer considers the situation that the robot may stack while the robot gets close to the wall and the sonor sensor may keep reporting that ""Sonar sense distance<=30"".If the system has any other logics, it should be explained explicitly.

Here, four methods, LF+MLN, Boost up Multi Layer Neural Network (B-MLN) that is  LF+B-MLN,  LF+Logarithm (L) and LF+Normalization (N)  are experimented. These Bangla ASR systems use 3000 sentences uttered by 30 speakers from a wide area of Bangladesh, where Bangla is used as a native language. In the experiments, LF are inputed into MLN for obtaining phoneme probabilities for all the Bengali phonemes considered in this study. These phoneme probabilities with some modifications (logarithm and normalization) are inputted to the hidden Markov model (HMM) based classifiers. From this study, it is observed that fewer mixture components are required in HMMs to obtain phoneme recognition performance.",0

A promising feature in todayâs world of HR monitoring is Photoplethysmography (PPG). However, during physical exercise HR estimation accuracy is seriously affected by noise and motion artifacts (MA). To estimate HR changes an algorithm is used named ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) along with spectrum subtraction (SS). EEMD algorithm decomposes a PPG signal and an acceleration signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) respectively. Due to a common sparsity constraint on spectral coefficients, this method can easily identify the noise related IMFs. After that correlation coefficient (CC) is determined by the spectrum of the acceleration signal and that PPG signal in the band of [0.4 Hz-5Hz]. If CC>0.5, SS is applied to remove the spectrum of the acceleration signal from the spectrum of the PPG signal. Finally, HR related peak is estimated.

The major contribution of this research work includes a dynamically configurable system framework that is capable of ensuring identification and authentication to every different type of devices within an IoT platform, a scalable system architecture that supports both limited-resource and ensemble devices. Another significant contribution of this work is multi-category security checking that address different aspects of IoT identification and authentication problem. Our proposed system is an application-layer based technology hence, easy to implement and deploy on edge devices and finally we also have presented a comparative discussion with existing approaches.",1

In embedding procedure, they applied seven levels DWT in host image.  Then DCT is applied in every sub-bands obtaining from DWT. Finally, SVD is used in selected sub-bands of DWT. The reason behind using multi-level DWT is the permutation & combination is increasing high with the increasing of the decomposition levels. So that it is difficult to extract watermark. On the other hand, human eyes are less sensitive to small alternation of singular values. So, using SVD along with DWT and DCT achieves good result in watermarking. Finally, as for watermark image they used three watermark image to increase the security level.
In this paper, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and Normalized Correlation (NC) are used to analyze the results. Also this technique is tested for various attacks such as salt & pepper noise, Gaussian noise, rotation, filtering, compression etc.

The figures 1-4 are not mentioned in the writings of the paper. “Watermarked Image” mentioned at the top of 1 should be named as “Host Image”.
The reason behind using DCT is not cleared.
Three watermarks are used to ensure security. But the NC and NCC values also decreased which may violate robustness and imperceptibility in the long run.
The name of Table III should be renamed since there is no indication of NCC values before various attacks.
In comparative analysis, the authors didn’t compare their method with any particular existing papers. So, it is better to compare their method with one or two existing paper.

Authors of the paper claimed that the application is effective, efficient and useful but no experimental or comparative analysis is given with other promising works in the literature. It makes the paper difficult to accept.
“the application was evaluated with 40 illiterate people through a ï¬eld study. The evaluation study showed that intuitive user interfaces is strongly important to develop a usable mobile application for illiterate people.” It is obvious that UI design is very crucial for any application. The contribution is just the development of a mobile application. No research challenge has been found in the paper. 
",20.0,Towards Developing a Mobile Application for Illiterate People in Bangladesh,"Human-Computer Interaction, usability, digital divide, pictography, icon, mobile user interface","Illiteracy is one of the main complications in developing 
countries like Bangladesh. The adoption and uses of the 
ICT based applications by the illiterate people of a developing 
country (like Bangladesh) is very essential to reduce the digital 
inequality and the digital divide for the social and economic 
development . The objective of this article is to develop a mobile 
application for job search for illiterate people in Bangladesh. To achieve this objective, firstly, 
a conceptual framework was proposed based on the findings of 
the literature survey and a need finding study, while the need 
findings study was replicated with 30 illiterate people. Secondly, 
an android based mobile application with user-intuitive user 
interface was developed. To make the interface intuitive for 
illiterate people, it encompasses voice, icon, pictography, minimal 
number of text in native language, and the like. Finally, the 
application was evaluated with 40 illiterate people through a field 
study. The evaluation study showed that intuitive user interfaces 
is strongly important to develop a usable mobile application 
for illiterate people. The study also found that the developed 
application was effective, efficient, useful and satisfiable to 
illiterate people, which in turn help them to adopt and use the 
ICT based applications in order to reduce the digital divide in 
Bangladesh.",0

In supervised learning good training of the classifier impacts on the system performance. How much dataset is used for training and testing? System should be analyzed with other machine learning approach like ROC response along with k fold validation.
Add figure captions (concerning figures of performance evaluation). Image quality is too poor too.
Another query is that Decision tree, multilayer perceptron, K-nearest neighbor has been used for comparing the system performance. Then why these are included in proposed methodology/workflow. It seems that, it should be in the literature review section.

787,8972,"In this paper, the authors introduced a lossless speech compression technique using Huffman algorithm with different binary coding system. The conventional Huffman coding system is applied to build a binary tree using probabilities of the symbols. The tree is built beginning with the leaves and merging with the two least probabilities. To construct the code, a different binary coding system is proposed where the binary combination of the shortest bits are assigned to the highest probabilities. ShanonFano and the Huffman coding are slightly related to each other. But reason behind using Huffman coding is that it generates same coding for the same symbol which is not possible in ShanonFano coding.
In this paper, compressed signal ratio, compression ratio (CR) and average code length (ACL) are used to analyze the results. They compare their results with arithmetic and Huffman coding and provide a better result than these two techniques.

In this paper the heart rate monitoring is based on photoplethysmoghaphy (PPG).

Thatâs mean it jointly estimates the spectra of PPG signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, utilizing the multiple measurement vector model in sparse signal recovery.

Theoretically, any body part can be used to measure heart rate through the sensor of the device, although wrist type things are commonly targeted. In this paper the heart rate monitoring is based on photoplethysmoghaphy (PPG). But during the physical Exercise it is tough to get the heart rate (HR) because then the PPG signals are vulnerable to motion artifacts (MA). To find HR an algorithm is presented here, which combines ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with spectrum subtraction (SS). Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition decomposes a PPG signal and acceleration signal into intrinsic mode function (IMF). Thatâs mean it jointly estimates the spectra of PPG signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, utilizing the multiple measurement vector model in sparse signal recovery. This method can easily identify and remove the spectral peaks of motion artifact (MA) from the PPG spectra. The method explained in this paper has better performance than other methods.",0

In the abstract, please consider revising the statement “Finally, we compare the original and recovered image based on cross-correlation coefficient and found the result of 1.0.”- can this value of 1 be true for any watermark image, please provide justification. Instead of stating a value of 1 the authors can mention it as ‘perfect correlation’. Also, please mention whether you consider this scheme as blind or non-blind.
Please replace Fig. 1 with a proper block diagram describing the embedding and extraction process.
Algorithm 2 should be placed under sub-section II.B.
Mention the value of ‘alpha’ for Table I.
Please consider revising the heading and content of Table I - they are confusing. What the authors mean by PSNR of the original image when the PSNR is calculated by comparing the watermarked image with the original one. The last two columns of Table I are not discussed in the text – please include relevant discussion.
If the NC value is max (i.e., 1) for both ref [14] and the proposed method, then there is no need of Fig. 2 – in this case just mention this in the text.
In Fig. 3, compare the NC value of the proposed method with that of ref [14] for all the noise attacks – otherwise this is not a valid comparison.
It is mentioned “The process time of our method outperforms the existing method in real time.” – what the authors mean by ‘real time’ in this context of image watermarking? The processing time comparison should be made for ref [14].
In Table II, replace ‘Different Wavelets (dB)’ by ‘PSNR (dB) for different Wavelets’.
In Fig. 4 to 9 mention PSNR values for watermarked image and extracted watermark. Instead of presenting these many figures, please present one set of figures to demonstrate the embedding and extraction process and another set for noise attack.
In Table III caption, replace ‘PROCESS’ by ‘PROCESSING’. In Table III, replace ‘*’ by ‘x’ and ‘sec’ by ‘s’. Why the proposed method is compared for embedding time only? Use ref [14] for this comparison as the authors used for other comparisons.
Please check and correct all the typos and grammatical errors. Replace ‘fig’ by ‘Fig’ and ‘Matlab’ by ‘MATLAB’ throughout the paper.

833,8981,"This paper discusses about PSD analysis-based detection of abnormal ECG signal. The paper is not well presented and does not demonstrate any technical contribution.

“Cascaded filtration” is mentioned in the paper title but there is no discussion about how the filter design was performed and corresponding filter parameters.
The paper mentions about detecting QRS complex in ECG signal which is not even properly introduced, i.e., its frequency characteristics have not been discussed.
It is mentioned in Section I “And to provide flexibility in the design of filters which is quite impossible with a band pass filter, a cascaded filtering system is used by cascading a high pass filter with a low pass filter to remove the power line interference as well as the baseline wandering noise.” – considering a overlapped frequency band, how cascading of a high-pass and a low-pass filter results in a filter other than a band pass type? What is the “flexibility” achieved in this process?
Discussions in Section III are not well presented. The PSD analysis results presented in Section III.E is misleading as the authors used different limit of frequency axis. As the frequency spectrum is symmetrical, there is no point in presenting the negative frequency axis. To discuss the PSD results, the authors used just one statement: “Difference among them is quite distinct.”. However, no supporting technical justification is provided.

The content of the paper is totally different than the title. Authors designed only two simple patch antennas at two different frequencies. There is nothing to justify that the work presented in the paper is related to wireless power transfer (WPT).
No rectifying circuit was presented in the paper to evaluate the performances of the rectenna.
The gain of the antenna was not shown in the paper. Normally gain of the simple patch antenna is low. On the other hand, rectenna needs high gain antenna. So it is not clear why the authors think that the proposed antennas are suitable for WPT.
The paper does not have any novelty and just the design of simple patch antennas can't be considered as new work. Design process and operational mechanism of a patch antenna is very well known in this field.

869,8981,"This paper discusses about a speaker identification approach based on the physiologically-based model of the auditory system. However, the proposed method is very similar to that of ref [4]. The authors were expected to discuss about the method presented in ref [4] and point out how their approach is different from the existing method. The authors should clearly mention what is the aim of this apparently repeated work.
The reviewer would like to provide the following comments on this paper:

The abstract is not aligned with the remaining part of the paper (even the conclusion). In abstract, the authors mentioned about using only the I-vectors for training the system but in Section II, they mentioned about using the whole ENV and TFS: “The whole ENV and TFS in the range of 20 CFs is used as a feature in GMM”.
Block diagram of Figure 1 should be fixed.
Please revise Section I for a smoother flow of discussion, especially the first paragraph.
Relevant literatures should be cited while discussing computation AN model of auditory system and the existing SID (at the first instance).
In Figure 2, first and third block should be named. Instead of “Classification Techniques” use name of the classifier. As the AN model is a critical part of this scheme, please make two separate blocks for pre-processing and AN model.
In the beginning of section II, please provide a summary of the overall system and then discuss about the training and testing phase.
Please remove Section II.A and place it under section III with the title ‘speech dataset’.
Please revise Section II.B. Please discuss about VAD or provide reference. Also provide reference for DTW.
It is mentioned “database of ‘University of Malaya (UM)’”- please provide reference of the database.
It is mentioned “sampling rate 8 Ch” – what do you mean actually? The unit of sampling rate is Hz. Please mention the correct sampling frequency.
Please elaborate ‘CFs’ at the first instance.
In Fig. 3, please use over lapping windows to illustrate the 2-D nature of the AN response (neurogram).
It is mentioned “In this project, feature extraction method is also applied after getting the AN response of the original speech wave files in this project.”- but the feature extraction method is not discussed clearly in Fig. 3.
It can be understood that, some of the sub-section headings are misplaced in Section II.
The authors provided a sub-section heading as “Gaussian mixture Model (GMM) & I-vectors” but included the discussion of neural network.
The presented discussions about the classifiers are questionable. They are not carefully written. Even the equations are not properly presented. It is not discussed how the classifiers were set up/ tuned (e.g. how many input and output layers the NN has).
In Section III. Results, it is mentioned “The ENV and TFS (neurograms) are generated by AN model is shown in figure 4.”- but in Fig. 4, SID accuracy is presented. Fig. 4 is not explained well – how the SNR of the clean signal was changed? Explain the characteristics of the added noise?
In Section III, both tables are numbered as ‘Table 1’.
In Section III, it is not discussed why the classifier accuracy differs from one another. This questions credibility of the work.
There should be a comparison between the results of ENV and TFS – which one is better for speaker identification.
Please check and correct all the typos and grammatical errors. For example:

In Section I, “which can be used for uniquely characterized a person”- here “characterized” should be “characterizing”.
“where speaker verification is another kind” should be corrected as “whereas speaker verification is another task”
“and so on factors” should be corrected as “and so on”.
“Then these signals of ear are represented into digital form and mean for speaker identification. The conversion within auditory system is one of the most sophisticated and complex system for understanding in depth.” – please rephrase these statements and make them consistent with the preceding discussion.
“In training phase, speaker model is creating” should be corrected as “In training phase, speaker model is created”
“a useful tool for the understanding the phycological and behavioural process of Huma auditory” - should be corrected as “a useful tool for the understanding of the phycological and behavioural process of Human auditory”
“The mean value is taken in row wise with respect to 20 CFS. Which is the feature in this project.” – please combine these two sentences.
“In this project, feature extraction method is also applied after getting the AN response of the original speech wave files in this project.” – please remove one instance of “In this project”.

Minor modification of a very well-studied protocol.
This protocol is designed for a special case of network where the BS is at the center of the field. In most of the practical Sensor network scenario this is not true.
The cluster head nodes are fixed which may cause these CH nodes to die very soon.
More diverse network scenario for simulation and a validation of simulation by numerical analysis is required.

Figures of the paper are blurred. Image quality should be improved.
Brief analysis should be presented how the nodes in the third level will be distributed under the clusters. Because in the second level, there are some nodes which don’t form any cluster as shown in Fig. 3.
It is mentioned in the paper that when L=5 and α=4, the best results are found. Why?
Brief explanation should be added why the energy consumption with respect to time is reduced for M-LEACH compared to LEACH because initially energy consumption is same for both approaches.
If there are no nodes in the second level, no cluster head is in second level to collect and send data to the BS. In this condition, how does the system work?

Abstract is too long!!
Your introduction section should have the following parts: It should contain the following four parts: a brief introduction de- scribing the discipline that the paper belongs to; a clear and concise statement of your problem; a brief explanation of your solution and its key ideas; a brief description of the results obtained and their impacts
The term  ""Matrix"" in Fig. 4, Fig.5 and Fig.6 are not clear as they are not two dimensional arrays!!!
  When two seperate methods are combined, there must have some increasing of computional costs. The recognition rate does not improve significantly.  Why? Space and Time complexities of the apprach should be given in a proper section.
The Section ""Conclusion"" is very long with unnecessary staements. In this section section, you need to elaborate on the impacts of using your approach. The second is to state limitations or disadvantages of your solution, thus enabling you to provide directions for future research in the field.

928,8972,"In this work, the authors proposed a combined image compression technique adjoining Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). For the compression, at first, the DWT transformation with a number of iterations is applied into the image.  Then two level IWT is applied on the approximation coefficients obtaining from DWT. Finally, two dimensional DCT is applied on the approximation coefficients attaining from IWT.
The main goal of this paper is to reduce fractional loss occurred in DWT and DWT-DCT compression and provides a better image quality of decompressed image by combining these three techniques.
 
Comments:

The detailed embedding procedure of proposed technique is not explained. They only presented the block diagram of encoding procedure in the paper.
The authors select the bi-orthogonal wavelet to use in filter analysis and synthesis. So, it is better to give some description or explanation of selecting this wavelet.
The iterations of DWT should be cleared. In one point they mentioned it three iterations and in other point it is two.
In comparative analysis, the authors didn’t compare their method with any particular existing papers. So, it is better to compare their method with one or two existing paper.

In watermarking technique, the usage of a special cover embeds the original image as watermark. Here to transform the cover image, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used that gains the LL sub-band, and later on transformed through discrete cosine transform (DCT). The generation as well as embedding of watermark is done through the modification of the transformed coefficients and the cover image through the variation of the scaling factor. Later on, the watermarked image is obtained through applying inverse discrete cosine with DWT on the reformed sub-bands. Afterward, to extract the watermark, an extraction process is required. In addition, salt & pepper noise can be enforced on watermarked image. Therefore, to eliminate high-density salt & pepper noise attack, this paper exploits âswitching threshold algorithmâ and implements it in two steps. At first, it detects whether pixels are corrupted ones or not due to salt & pepper noise. Then using an adaptive length window with maximum size of 7x7, new pixel values are projected only for corrupted pixels. Finally, the performance of the proposed technique is evaluated w.r.t.

Therefore, proper identification and classification of bacteria is essential to prevent the outbreak of such life-threatening diseases. But Manual identification and classification of bacteria from microscopic image samples requires professional individuals and reasonable amount of time. However, the process could be automated with the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-vision technologies. An effectively trained AI could efficiently classify bacteria and save a large amount of time as well as human-effort. In this paper, a unique approach has been investigated to classify bacteria from microscopic image samples. An AI has been developed by combining a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform this operation. Using the transfer-learning method, the Inception V3 DCNN architecture has been modified and retrained with more than 800 image samples of seven separate bacteria species, which are 80% of the image-dataset. The features extracted by the retrained DCNN were then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The hybrid network was then tested on the rest 20% of images and the network efficiently classified the images of seven individual kinds of bacteria samples with accuracy-level of around 96%.",1

In comparison to rectangular and circular antenna arrays, triangular antenna array exhibits better performance in terms of Radiation Efficiency, S11, VSWR and BW with a staggering efficiency of 99.1%, S11 of -39.44dB, VSWR of 1.024 and BW of 103.4GHz. All the three types of antennas are highly efficient. Circular antenna array with Radiation efficiency greater than 88.1% and rectangular antenna array with efficiency greater than 98.09% have been recorded for different substrate heights.",0

The single element antenna shows two bands at 29 and 40.5 GHz. What is the reason for producing 4 bands when array is formed?
The author should explain the mechanism why the single element antenna produces dual-band.

 Gains of single element are 5.69 and 4.54 dBi. After forming arrays, gain increases around 2-3 dBi. Even it not increases when the array is extended from 4×1 to 4×2. So I think the performance of the array is not good.
The radiation pattern is not good in boreside direction. The pattern is worst after making array. The pattern is not smooth at all. So I think the performance of the array is not good and acceptable.

Author(s) should have followed the conference template strictly.Some of the areas which need special attention in this case are:

Author(s) need to define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. For example, HSI- abbreviation of Hyperspectral Imageis used in the “Introduction” without defining first. Similarly, some more abbreviations are needed to be defined first in the “Introduction” section.
Author(s) should have used upper case and lower case letters uniformly in the text. For example, “Finally the kernel Support VectorMachine (KSVM) is used for measuring the accuracy of theproposed approach.”- thelast line of the “Introduction” section needs to be reviewed.
When citing more than one source at a time, the preferred method is to list each reference number separately with a comma or dash between each reference. But some references in “Introduction” section have been cited a [2],[6] and [7],[8] in the text.
Author(s) should put Fig. 2 after it has been cited in the text and pay attention to cite the figures in the text in a uniform manner.


References are not properly formatted. Author(s) should format the reference section according to IEEE citation format. Following references needs to be checked again:

Conference proceedings need more details such as conference place and date, publishers name (if any) etc.
Reference [3], [7], and [15] have missing important citation details.

So suggestion to author(s) is to review latest works in area and add to the paper to improve the quality. A detail comparative study is required with existing works.

Finally, the de-noised image is obtained by performing the DWT using Bayesian thresholding on the log compressed image. The new technique exhibits excellent quantitative and visual performances in terms of Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE) & Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) over the conventional techniques.

Some points :
 

It is best to leave out so many uncited statistic in the abstract
Introduction reads more like a newspaper or magazine article than a technical paper. Nevertheless I do appreciate the intensity and genuine feelings of the authors as expressed the introduction.

There is a huge difference in actually discreetly wearing the device and using it in hand as a prototype.  Use study, feedback and physical simulation of common scenarios would enrich the paper.

As a result even when switch S5 and S8 is Closed according to methodology, there is no current path between them. Closing them becomes redundant when S6 and S7 are still open. So, the load connection should be pointed clearly to avoid this error.4. The comparison of the proposed topology with the conventional inverters are very optimal. This proves the claim of less cost, the lower switching loss of the proposed inverter. But, as promised in the abstract,5. There is no indication to prove there will be low electromagnetic interference.6. There is no comparison to proof the THD is better than the established topologies.7.

For reducing the intense pressure of electrical power, the renewable sources of energy play a tenor role. Power of renewable sources is converted to grid power by using dc to ac conversion topologies and reduced switch multilevel inverter is the best solution for this conversion of energy because of its advantages like low cost, better output power, lower switching loss, lesser third harmonic distortion, lower electromagnetic interference. This paper represents a modified and experimentally structured reduced switch multilevel inverter for generating three-phase twenty-one level output voltage waveform. The inverter avails only eight switches and four voltages sources per phase proposed here. The advisable features of this inverter are obtained by comparing existing topologies with proposed topology. The simulation results for different switching angle calculation methods especially Half Height (HH) method is analyzed and presented. This performance result of this proposed inverter is dissembled by MATLAB Simulink software.",0

Interpretation of the PESQ values / scores obtained in Fig 5 need to be more detailed ( benchmark them again MOS scale for PESQ). Many recent systems have achieved much higher PESQ results ranging from 2.5 to above 3.0 for similar applications.

Manuscript presents a good problem. But the manuscript fails to prove a technical contribution in the discipline. Authors need to clarify the some portions of the methodology mentioned below in order to claim the novelty of the manuscript:

Block diagram (Fig. 1) of the proposed system doesn’t have any module for weight calculation in case of non-organic waste, but in Table I author(s) mentioned that except one waste item of E-waste category (i.e. Display Units)  all other non- organic waste are priced in terms of weight (unit of Price column is BDT/Kg) . Similarly, the flowchart of the non-organic waste management procedure suggests that the total recycle value is calculated according to the object number.
Also, in case of organic waste Table I show three categories by block diagram in Fig. 1 doesn’t have any module to categorize this organic waste.
The section “THEORY” seemed really irrelevant, rather author(s) should focused on describing the proposed system in more details and also should have explain how the algorithm described in section “THEORY” was used by their proposed system with sample input and outputs.
There was no final output of price calculation or system making it hard to believe that system was implemented and evaluated in real.


References are not properly formatted. Author(s) should format the reference section according to IEEE citation format. Following references needs to be checked again:

An efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based image classifier has been developed which is able to detect and recognize any object regarded as garbage by analyzing training features. Additionally, it can also count the number of labeled objects and assign a price value to each object. The waste brought by any individual to the ATD will readily be recognized by the image classifier and the recycle value which has been assigned for that object can be withdrawn by that individual. So, a direct exchange of waste and its equivalent price is possible which will incentivize people to use our smart dustbin.

Some points :
 

The motivation  in the context of Bangladesh can be made more appealing if some work or statistics can be cited on the involvement of children in our society in the hazardous work of waste sorting
Dataset used for learning should be bigger for better results. A set of 20 images is too small!
The flowcharts could be made more professional with properly sized fonts.  The equations are best inserted using equation editor.
Why was the pricing set the way it is showed? Some reference would make the authors' choice more significant.
What would happen if a user mistakenly places organic trash in the non-organic bin?  Error cases can be discussed to make the paper even stronger!

We found that monolayer 2D-SiC has a direct bandgap of 2.71 eV that can be tuned by introducing vacancy defect. The number of the conduction band and the valence band are significantly increased in 2D-SiC for both C and Si vacancy defects. Moreover, the bandgap of 2D-SiC is decresed to 1.7028eV and 2.4664eV than that of the pure 2D-SiC (2.71eV) due to the incorporation of C and Si vacancies, respectively. The effect of spin orbital coupling combined with vacancies are also studied and found to be significant impact on the electronic structure of 2D-SiC. These findings suggest that unlike silicon and graphene the monolayer 2D-SiC could be a decent candidate for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.",0

These abilities help us understand our surroundings and respond accordingly. However, sometimes, due to innate reasons or trauma, some people are deprived of these functionalities. In order to restore the natural motor functionalities to people with such disabilities, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) has been widely employed with other Human Computer Interaction (HCI) measures to find an optimum solution that ensures a high speed system with reasonable accuracy. In this paper, we have explored one of such systems for Text Entry mechanism using BCI. We have addressed the following three challenges for a BCI based Text Entry system- i)Four motor imagery signal based interaction ii)Processing and classification of noisy EEG data using the available methods iii) Language prediction model to increase input speed. We have tried to contribute in designing the Keyboard Layout for the Text Entry. Existing soft keyboard layouts for BCI systems have either a flat layout or a hierarchical static layout with very few functionalities in more than 2 layers. We propose to improve the hierarchical layout using a 2 layer multi-functional approach. We have prepared a prototype solution to substantiate our hypothesis. With a cognitive walk-through based evaluation we have validated our hierarchical layoutâs performance to be accurate and more functional.",1

The most common and efficient technology in this purpose is the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology. This technology allows the proper detection, diagnosis and evaluation of brain tumor. In this paper, we have suggested an efficient and noble approach for the proper detection and classification of brain tumor. This method includes a proper combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM). We have done segmentation using Otsu thresholding. The features were extracted using the DWT method. Then the extracted features were reduced by using PCA method. The results are given to the KSVM for classification of the brain tumor as Benign or Malignant. It was found that out of four kernels the linear kernel has the highest accuracy using the proposed method in the given situation. The proposed technique is efficient, easy to implement and gives higher accuracy.",0

In the Wideband range, traditional Narrowband Sensing methods are not suitable to apply for performing Wideband Spectrum Sensing, as of making a single binary decision (Primary User present or absent) in the entire Wideband signal, thus cannot locate individual spectral opportunities that rely within the Wideband Spectrum. The Compressive Sensing (CS) can recover sparse signals at Sub-Nyquist rates and it depends on this principle of sparsity, so that a brief representation of the signal is possible when expressed in a suitable form. This research work has proposed a model of CR receiver sensing module which can be able to estimate a significant part (which is highly sparse among the segments of the spectrum) of the entire Wideband Spectrum with lower computational complexity. This proposed work aims to analyze the Compression Ratio, i.e., M/N, with different number of Primary User (PUs) present in the wideband frequency and the energy estimator performances with respect to the compression ratio, M/N we observed that the accuracy of energy estimator increases with the increment of the value of compression ratio, M/N. Additionally, it is also analyzed that how the Compression Ratio, M/N characteristics varies with Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the wideband frequency from the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. This work investigates the probability of detection, Pd versus SNR for a fixed M/N. It can hopefully state in the final point that the proposed method proves its significance in CR system.",0

It is gratefully sorry but it seems to be concerened to modify the vital part of the paper; Goal and Method.

The reviewer could not read an overview of the methodology of the work. The paper probably wants such information in Section I.
The reviewer could not understand propriety of the method.

In the paper, it is said that Canny edge detector is selected as the edge detector for the work on the point of quality. The reviewer failed to read detailed requirement of selecting an edge detector. In some case the other edge detecotrs would be more effective than Canny because of difference of meaning of the value stored in pixels. Actually, Canny method executes binalization to extract proper edge position. On the other hand, the other methods calculate some value like gradient information of edges and store in pixels. So images through these methods might be unclear for humans, although the images could be more informative than images by Canny. Although the paper says noise are suppressed by Canny, the reviewer also could not distinguish what are noise by watching the images. It should be required to explain what is the noise and the effectiveness of the noise reduction effect for superimposing.
The reviewer also could not find out the repeatable way for superimposing images. How is the detailed flow of superimpose in the paper? It should include the probrem of alignment between them.
The reviewer could not understand why thresholding is needed after superimposing images through Canny, while they must be binalized in the process. Additional explanation about the reason why employ thresholding would be required.


Introducing the method of reduction of dimension of a binalized image is seemed to be redundant.The authors have to construct the story why the method is highly required for the work and and show its effectiveness, result, contribution, impact.Otherwise, the topic should be removed because it is subtopic and does not highly related to the goal of the paper.

1457,8170,0,30.0,A Novel Transformerless Single Phase Inverter for Grid-Tied PV Systems,"Single-phase inverter, Grid-tied photovoltaic system, Transformerless, Total harmonic distortion, Leakage current","Transformerless inverter is widely used in grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) generation system. A small, lightweight, low cost, and high efficiency grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system can be achieved when the transformer is omitted from the inverter. However, one of the technical challenges of the transformerless inverter is the safety issue due to leakage current. The leakage current increases the conducted and radiated electromagnetic interference, total harmonic distortion (THD), and losses. Moreover, injection of direct current (DC) to the grid can saturate the distribution transformer along the grid. To solve these issues, different conversion topologies can be used.

1471,8981,"This paper presents design and development of an electromechanical ventilator system using two cam arms mechanism. As mentioned in Section I and II, the use of cam mechanism in this kind of system is an existing concept. In Section II.C, the authors have claimed the novelty of their contribution mainly in the additional features: portability, battery operated, reduced size and noise removal along with precision. Unfortunately, none of these features is demonstrated (and evaluated) from the performance analysis results of the prototype system.
The theory behind the design is not well explained and corresponding performance analysis results are not presented. In Section II.F, towards the end of second paragraph the authors have mentioned “Now we want to find out the angle between two CAM arms because the output volume depends on the angle between two arms”, i.e., a relationship between θa and volume V is expected. The authors considered a linear relationship between θa and V which is presented in Eq. (3). But value of the constant k2 is not provided and corresponding linear relationship is not verified by appropriate experimentations. Again, in Eq. (4), the authors have showed a linear relationship between the radius rp of the pully and the output volume V – this indicates that, for a specified output V the value of k must be known to determine rp, which is not provided.
The major limitation of the system is its inability to measure the output volume in real time and corresponding control mechanism (i.e. corresponding control of θa) which will restrict its application in a real case. The use of nonflexible cot wire to connect arms to the pulleys is an unsafe design concept. A broken wire in the proposed open loop system can put the patient at life risk. Any safety feature of the system to avoid this kind of unsafe operation is not demonstrated.
The integration of BSL system with the proposed system is not well demonstrated.
According to the results presented in Table I to III, precision of the system is not at the expected level (compared to the existing systems).
The overall presentation quality of the paper is not of academic publication standard.

In this paper the most crucial part is survey hence how questions are set should have some clarity which is completely missing. Survey is conducted on existing CS/CSE student which is not acceptable. If you take survey of SSC/HSC student and predict their chances of doing well in Bachelor then it will make more sense.
Various public and private universities along geographical areas should be considered because the respondents should be from mixed background. 
The way survey is conducted it was obvious that CGPA and programing skill will reflect how good or bad a particular student will be in CSE program. Do we really need any machine learning algorithm? I mean what is the point of taking survey? Someone can just feed some CGPA s  from different semester in any ML algorithm and it will produce predicted CGPA.
Perhaps CGPA vs higher Study vs Income  can be considered to make the study more interesting. Otherwise your contribution is very narrow.

So, it is tough to deliver something in the natural calamity. Also, a delivery man is needed to deliver the documents or files inside of an office or a building to another building of a company. To solve the problem and to automate the delivery process, this research proposes an amphibious line following robot that can move in both lands and at a certain level of water. This line following robot reaches its destination by following the path that is predefined as a white line over a black surface. To determine the line, IR sensor is used whose led emits an infrared ray and detector led receives the infrared ray. By a pre-defined threshold value, the robot can sense the line. L293D motor driver controls the speed and direction of the wheel of the vehicle. DC motor is attached along with the wheel of the vehicle for the purpose of rotation.  The system can sense the flooded road through embedded water sensor and activate the propeller function to move like a speedboat. As the proposed robot is an autonomous system, it is free from any direct human involvement. The system is made of a relatively low cost, low power consumption and easy to install.",1

With the rapid advancement of technology, day by day the number of industries and factories, which are responsible for environmental pollution are increasing rapidly. To control the pollution in the air or in an environment, continuous monitoring is necessary. But most of the existing systems are expensive and complicated.  But dilatory increases in low-cost air quality monitoring systems are responsible for overall degradation. To solve this problem, we proposed an air pollution detection and monitoring system, which is simple in design, mobile, and low cost. Our proposed monitoring system embodies a device made of various gas sensors, GSM module, a cloud server, and a mobile application. In our implemented device, one can easily access the data from the server and app to monitor the air pollution condition. Also, it consists of an alert system, which will send a notification to responsible officials if the pollution parameter exceeds the standard permissible limit.",0

Title of the paper: Fabrication of Digital Sol-Gel DIP Coating System with Smart Beaker Carrier
The article reported the improvement of conventional Sol-Gel coating system for fabrication of efficient thin films. The author proposed that the digital sol-gel dip coating system was a very useful technique for fabricating multilayered films. However, before accepting this article, some major issues and suggestions should be clarified.

The results such as transmittance spectra, absorption coefficient etc of ZnO thin film using digital sol-gel system should be compared with that of ZnO thin film prepared by conventional Sol-Gel coating system keeping same growth parameters and environment.
Besides fabrication of thin film using this modified Sol-Gel coating system, is it possible to prepare nano-particles or nano-composites materials?
More focused results and discussion should be presented.

In Fig. 4, the impedance bandwidth is almost same for either FR4 substrate or air. BW of inset feed rectangular as shown in figure when FR4 substrate is used is quite narrow, but it seems that the same BW can be obtained by proper impedance matching. So, the comment regarding BW done by the authors that better BW can be obtained by using air is not appropriate as per their result.

This paper presents an efficient model reduction strategy for discrete-time index-2 descriptor control systems. It is a very well-written paper with significant level of novelty. But it would be better if author(s) can mention some of its application areas.
When citing more than one source at a time, the preferred method is to list each reference number separately with a comma or dash between each reference such as [5-7] or [3, 4].
Author(s) need to define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract (e.g. in second paragraph of the section- “I. INTRODUCTION” author(s) need to define LTI first).
In “REFERENCES” section author(s) need to review the use of double quotation (“ ”) in case of paper titles and also last line of reference number [13] needs to be indented.

Hand Sign/Gesture Recognition is one of the significant areas where the deep neural network is making a substantial impact. In the last few years, a large number of researches has been conducted to recognize hand signs and hand gestures, which we aim to extend to our mother-tongue, Bangla (also known as Bengali). The primary goal of our work is to make an automated tool to aid the people who are unable to speak.

According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), 15% of people in the world live with some kind of disabilities. Among them, individuals with communication impairment such as speech disabilities experience substantial barrier in social interaction. The proposed system can be invaluable to mitigate such a barrier. The core of the system is built with a deep learning model which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The model classifies hand sign based digits with 92% accuracy over validation data which ensures it a highly trustworthy system. Upon classification of the digits, the resulting output is fed to the text to speech engine and the translator unit eventually which generates audio output in Bangla language.

In section I, authors should clearly state which is the step-ahead with respect to the state-of-the-art, indicating which issues are addressed by the paper that is not addressed in the cited papers
The relevant cited papers are very old as the most recent cited paper is from 2013 that does not reflect the recent research advancement in the related field.
The findings related to the research seem too old and commonplace as the authors compare the performance of detection techniques in figure 6 that are very well-known in the field. In addition, authors compare the ROC and CROC performances among fading channels in figures 4, and 5 wherein Nakagami is one of the channels. As changing the value of “m” in Nakagami fading, Rician and Rayleigh channel also can be generated, and the performance varies for different “m” values, it’s unworthy to evaluate for three types of fading channels from the reviewer sense.
Under a specific fading environment, the betterment of performance with the increase of SNR values is also very well known in the communication field, which is shown in figures 2, and 3.
For comparison purpose, legends used for different techniques and different values are not clear enough to differentiate among plots as in black-and-white version all plots look almost the same in a figure. Authors can use different lines and markers to differentiate among performances. In addition, the X and Y axes values in figures 2 and 3 are ambiguous in a normal readable pdf format.
Authors should write elaboration of the contracted forms (e.g., ROC, CROC) used throughout the paper.
Some grammatical errors exist in section I that need a rectification.
In the numerical result description section, authors often discuss the parameter value setup, rarely discuss the findings and the reasons behind findings, which make this section poorly organized and described.

A dielectric substrate of Rogers-3010 with thickness of 1 mm is used in this  design and the radius of the proposed design is 8.4 mm.  The resonance frequency of the proposed antenna is 910 MHz, and  the achieved  -10  dB  impedance  bandwidth  is  21.98%  and  3dB axial  ratio  bandwidth  is  17.86%  in  free  space  which  is  in  ISM  band (902-928  MHz).  The  performance  of  the  proposed  antenna  is  also assessed in three-layer phantom model to validate for  the biotelemetry applications. In phantom model simulation, the resonance frequency is shifted  toward  lower  values  by  200  MHz  and  the  obtained  -10  dB impedance  bandwidth  is  17.09%.  Then,  the  shift  in  resonance  is mitigated  by  redesigning  the  antenna.  The  radius  of  the  redesigned antenna  is  8.1 mm.  The  attained  maximum  gain  of  the  proposed antenna is  -21.9  dB and  -15.18  dB  at  the  resonance frequency  in  the free  space  and  phantom  model  simulations  respectively.  In  addition, the  specific  absorption  rate  (SAR)  of  the  proposed  antenna  inside phantom  model  is  determined  for  assuring  biocompatibility  and

Optical transmittance and absorbance of the films have been measured by Ultra Violet (UV) spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200nm - 800nm. In the visible and infrared range, the films exhibit low absorbance and high optical transmittance which proves the great optical transparency of the films.",0

It is not clear why the authors considered Rajshahi University Campus as they did not practically used the real network instead they simulate the networks. Similar network configuration is possible for any other campus area networks. Even, Fig. 1 (the map of RU) is irrelevant with the technical findings of the paper.
In literature there are a lot of papers that focus on the performance comparison of delay-tolerant network routing protocols. Author need to summarize them and explain their differences with the proposed comparison.
The main finding of this paper is the Spray-and Focus routing protocol outperforms the competitors. Which definitely not a new finding. Authors also need to identify the reasons behind such results.

DTN uses store-carry-forward approach where message is transferred from source node to destination node through intermediate nodes by opportunistic contacts due to node movement. These intermediate nodes store the message in their buffer, carry it while on the move and forward it to the next intermediate node encountered. Eventually, the message is delivered to the destination node. An important application of DTN is considered to provide for emergency message delivery to key personnel in a disaster-stricken area. The main challenge of DTN is to adopt an appropriate routing technique to deliver message in the most efficient way. In this paper, we look into the performances of DTN routing protocols such as Epidemic, MaxProp, Spray-and-Wait (SnW), and Spray-and-Focus (SnF) by considering the campus area of Rajshahi University, Bangladesh. We use the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator for the simulation. The performance of the DTN routing protocols is analyzed based on four metrics: delivery probability, average latency, transmission cost, and average hop count by varying the message size and the number of nodes per group.

1839,8981,"This paper discusses about the application of DNN to classify fNIR signals of mental arithmetic tasks. The authors used mcfly to obtain a range of DNN models which have resulted in 100% classification accuracy. However, the work failed to demonstrate an original and credible technical contribution due to the following reasons:

The paper used the dataset from ref [7] (although the actual database website has not been cited). To eliminate artefact and baseline drifts ref [7] used a band pass filter with pass band 0.01 Hz to 0.09 Hz whereas this present work used a frequency band of 0.012 Hz to 0.8 Hz. However, the authors did not justify why they chose such a higher value of upper cut-off frequency.
Although the authors mentioned about trials, but the actual sample size and percentage size of training and testing set are not mentioned.
The authors used mcfly to automatically generate the DNN models. Therefore, the model architecture cannot be considered as authors’ contribution. Moreover, hyperparameters of the finally selected CNN model are not provided which restricts understandability and reproducibility of the work.
It is mentioned “In case of classification, all 8 subjects were concatenated to make a larger dataset”- it is not clear how this concatenation can increase the dataset size, it supposed to decrease the total number of samples as multiple samples are merged into one. It is also mentioned “by concatenating all subject, these models are capable of handle any subject” – this is not a rational generalization. The perfect classification result (100%) seems to be a result of overfitting.

An efficient cryptology algorithm is introduced in this paper to offer comparatively higher security of data. In this algorithm, the plaintext to be encrypted is converted into unprintable characters. For encryption, a competent technique is applied based on ASCII and number system conversions which make this algorithm different from others. In the steps of the algorithm, each character of the plaintext is first converted into its equivalent ASCII (decimal) which is further converted to its equivalent octal and hexadecimal numbers. Then, using some matrix manipulations on the decimal, octal and hexadecimal representation of each character the character is transformed to 5 unprintable characters to form the intermediate cipher text. After that, every unprintable character in the intermediate cipher text is further converted into a different unprintable character using a cyclic mathematical function. Performing three steps of processing, the final encrypted text is produced that gives higher level of security. In this way, as there can have total 32 unprintable characters, it will take much time (for a plaintext of only 4 characters it takes 1.53 years to break down) if the intruders try to decrypt the original message with every probable combination. Though the length of the encrypted message is larger than original message in this proposed algorithm, it offers higher security for the real-time communications.",0

1945,8106,"The paper contains Authors Information, which technically doesn’t follow the blind review process.ï· Several typos and grammatical inconsistencies throughout the paper can be seen.ï· “In our research work, we use such positive, negative word as a determinator for sentiment analysis” – Thisis actually Lexical Approach.ï· MAIN CONTRIBUTION –1. “Reducing complexity as our proposed system doesn’t work with Bangla grammar” – This is not clearas of what ‘complexity’ are the authors trying to reduce? Grammatical Ambiguity related complexityor something else?2. “Inspecting user opinion on particular issue” – This is quite different from sentiment analysis as theyare only considering positive/negative sentiment which doesn’t involve dealing with the topic of theopinion.ï· RELATED WORKS – Irrelevant related works are cited, mostly English. A significant number of works hasalready been done in terms of Bangla Sentiment Analysis. Again, authors have mentioned only about theaccuracy in this section but not the size of the dataset as the evaluation depends on the dataset being used.ï· DATASET –1. Authors only considered a total of 100 comments for testing purpose which is not enough tocomment on the accuracy/f1 scoring.2. “For training, we have recorded 500 weighted feature words for positive and negative sentiment” –No mention of how they have chosen those 500 features (words) and how they have weightedthem!!ï· PREPROCESSING –1. For each sentence remove stop words (“à¥¤“ , “ ? ” ) -- à¥¤ or ? are not stop words.2. Authors most probably used POS as features but didn’t mention which POS-tag they considered (i.e.,only adverb or adjectives or something else??).ï· TRAINED DATABASE –1. This is probably the biggest weakness of this paper. According to the authors – “For the purpose oftraining database, we store positive and negative words. For positive words, a specific weight valueis assigned and another weight value is provided for negative words”2. Above cannot be considered as Training. They just stored some word’s without context and scoredthem according to some intuition (which they didn’t mention in the paper).ï· NEGATION HANDLING – No specific details are given about how to determine which words/phrases act as‘Negators’. The scope of negation is not that simple and is itself a research domain. For example, ‘good’ isitself a positive word and ‘hell’ could be treated as a negative word. But if we say “good as hell” than simplyadding those scores together won’t give us the actual prediction.ï· SENTIMENT DETECTION –1. “If total weight of positive words is greater than that of negative words then the output is positiveotherwise the output or comment is negative” – This again raises the question that how the weightsare being assigned. A word could be either positive or negative depending on the context (forexample - badass). Simply adding the weights will not guarantee the overall results are either beingin a specified class.ï· EVALUATION --1. Although the result shows promisingly high scores, in reality, the Test Set is too small forgeneralization.2. The comparison of the proposed and existing system is not accurate since no mention of training ortesting data are given for each of those systems.3.

To attain our aim we have designed and simulate a prototype of reservation based parking system by using our developed mobile application. With the support of real-time tracking of parking status, our parking system will dynamically update the parking slot details and price rate with the help of various sensing technologies. Our developed android application will help the car driver to find the available parking spot in the nearest location. To maintain the parking details of various users a Java-based desktop application has been developed.",0

Gain is stated as 6.8398 dB in Section III and in Table I, 6.83 dB is mentioned as directivity. This makes a confusion as gain and directivity are not same thing. Another thing is that gain of CP antenna is defined by dBic. Authors should present gain vs frequency curve in the paper.
Two ports are used to excite the antenna. Excitation mechanism should be mentioned clearly. Are both ports excited at the same time to get CP? What are the relations among amplitudes and phases of the two ports?

For developing mathematical models datasets of National Health and Nutrition Surveyâ (NHNS) 2016, United States of America (USA) have been used which provide experimental data with other required physical data. In this research total 166 (81 male and 85 female) data have been used. Age, height, extracellular resistance, frequency, body mass index (BMI) are used for the development of mathematical models. The proposed models have been analyzed statistically by finding correlation (Pearson) coefficients, intervals of limit of agreement (LOA) and absolute errors comparing with actual data. The results show that the correlation (Pearson) coefficients are 0.98 for both male and female individuals which denote excellent matching with actual data. Besides intervals of LOA are only 1.074 L [-1.3350 L to 2.4090 L] and 0.418803 L [-1.42557 L to 1.844373 L] for male and female data respectively.

Authors should clearly explain the benefits of using monopole antenna instead of other antennas.
Authors of the paper mentioned that the antenna has a linearly polarized omnidirectional pattern like a conventional dipole. But no radiation pattern is presented in the paper. How can they ensure that statement without any graph?
The current distribution of the antenna should be presented.
How much gain can be obtained by these three antennas? No available data in the paper.
The antenna has a low input resistance ≈ 20 Ω due the reduction in size by meandering the monopole. Detail analysis should be presented.
I think the results presented in the paper are without considering human tissue model because in Fig. 5, the antenna is bended without keeping the tissue model behind it.

To meet the current necessity of undisrupted power supply, researchers are working on different renewable and green energy sources. For powering up devices, it is required to make the wired connection either with batteries or with a grid line. However, the batteries are subjected to charging and maintenance which makes it difficult to charge it every now and then in conventional ways at locations such as busy roads and remote places. To solve this situation, energy harvesting technique using piezoelectric material can be used. This technique is mainly based on converting mechanical stress into electrical energy by means of low-frequency vibration using piezoelectric effect. In this paper, we have proposed an innovative way to harvest energy by piezoelectric effect in the roads using the vibratory motion of vehicles. There are several works that had been done on harvesting energy from piezoelectric material, but the limitation of this kind of energy sources is that it provides a micro level of energy. Our motivation is to provide a circuitry using a boost converter to level up the output voltage and hence increase the efficiency.

Natural Language Processing holds great promise since people will hopefully be able to talk to the computer in their own language. Closer ties between AI and experimental psychology will enhance the development of the principles of artificial intelligence and their implementation in computers. In human behavior, repetitiveness is a common characteristic. It increases importance of a neural node. Repetitiveness shows which node updates frequently. So the update time interval will be very less. Ranking of graph node in neural network is necessary to allocate it in robotâs short and long term memory.

Natural Language Processing holds great promise since people will hopefully be able to talk to the computer in their own language. Closer ties between AI and experimental psychology will enhance the development of the principles of artificial intelligence and their implementation in computers. In human behavior, repetitiveness is a common characteristic. It increases importance of a neural node. Repetitiveness shows which node updates frequently. So the update time interval will be very less. Ranking of graph node in neural network is necessary to allocate it in robotâs short and long term memory.

2118,8981,"This paper describes a method for ALS patient identification using the EEG signal obtained by P300 Speller scheme. Wavelet transform was applied to extract alpha and beta bands from the raw EEG signals. The authors have compared the RMS of Alpha and Beta waves to identify ALS (Bulbar and Spinal) affected and normal person. Novelty of the technical contribution is questionable as no discussion on related works is provided. The authors are requested to improve the paper based on the following comments:

Please include a literature review section discussing the state-of-the-art techniques of EEG-based ALS detection. Also, justify novelty of your method.
In Section I, please provide reference for EEG wave classification. It is mentioned “The Alpha andBeta waves can be affected bydifferent drugs such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines etc” – please provide reference for this information.
As the dataset is collected from the Neuroelectrical Imaging and BCI Laboratory, IRCCS Fondazione, Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy, please provide their database website as reference in Section II.A.
Equation (1) is not necessary and you have already mentioned it in the text. Also, make correction of Eq. (2) – you have incorrectly mention it for ‘DWT’, it is actually for CWT. Please clarify whether you used DWT of CWT in your work and provide corresponding standard presentation of WT with reference. Also, fix the symbol used for the space of square integrable functions.
Please use ‘Figure X’ instead of ‘Figure 0X’ throughout the paper.
In Figure 05 caption, the subfigures (a and b) should be described separately. Follow the same suggestion for the other figures.
The title of ‘Data Selection’ should be changed to ‘Wavelet scale selection’ for better clarity. Also, discuss how the scales are related to frequency bands.
While referring Figure 07 it is mentioned “Figure 07(a) shows the Alpha and Figure 07(b) shows the Beta waves of three persons with Spinal ALS.” – here ‘three persons with Spinal ALS’ should be corrected as ‘three normal persons’ (as mentioned in the Figure 07 caption).
Please rearrange the references in the ‘REFERENCES’ section as they appear in the paper.

The online social networks (OSNs) are not only giving positive supports to its users, but also creating opportunities to assassin personals by the trolls. Trolls are usually the OSN users who try to hide themselves while doing bad comments, false accusations, starting controversies, spreading fake news or rumors which could be considered as character assassination of individuals. The online behavior of an OSN user could be tracked via his/her digital footprints. Though tracking huge number of users who are generating billions of textual and image data every day, could be considered as a challenging task. In this paper, we have proposed a novel detection system for identifying character assassination from social media platforms. The proposed method first predicts the personality traits using usersâ textual data. Therefore, LIWC, SlangNet, SentiWordNet, SentiStrength, Colloquial WordNet has been utilized as psycholinguistic tool. LIWC-based feature engineering has been performed on the comments of the trolls as well as the victim user. SlangNet and Colloquial WordNet is used for detecting English slang words in the comments as it is evident that slangs are the basic communicative way to defame someone.",1

2143,9039,"Hi,
Please consider the following comments:

The overall structure of the paper is not up to the mark. It's difficult to follow the paper from the general audience perspective. 
There are many typos and grammatical errors in the paper. Authors should be considered it well before submitting to any prestigious conference such as hosted by IEEE.
It's good to start with the block diagram before starting the description of the methodology and it gives a picture to the audience.
The steps in E and F could come into one part. At this stage, it's not meaning any good sense. Please try to map into one step and it will reduce the complexity of the algorithm.
Also, the discussion shouldn't come as a separate section. It would be better if it came within the  Evolution and Results part.
Simply using DCNN doesn't make any sense, as there are a lot of methods which can address the problem mentioned.  Thus, a strong justification should be provided at the beginning of choosing DCNN.
Training DCNN is an arduous task. Thus, time complexity should have been considered while considering deep learning techniques.

The authors didn’t present the operational mechanism of the antenna. Why the antenna is radiated in the three distinct band? need to be explained.
Why the S-parameter is above the 0 dB? It is impossible in that case. So it indicates that the simulation was done by setting wrong simulation parameters.
The radiation patterns shown in Fig. 6 and 7 are not good as dip is observed in bore side direction. I think, the antenna is resonated at the frequencies of 21.53 and 37.3 GHz due to the higher order modes. That’s why the radiation pattern is not good enough at those frequencies.

The authors should clearly explain the design method of the antenna. How do they determine the shape of the antenna and hand size? What is the reason for choosing the number of hand in the star-fish as 10? Is there any technique to determine number of hand with respect to frequency?
The author should clearly explain the benefits of using star-fish shape instead of other shapes mentioned in Introduction, Ref-10-13.
According to Fig. 3, it seems that 84.84 GHz band is the 2nd order resonant mode of the fundamental mode frequency, 44.74 GHz. The authors should investigate the radiation pattern at 84.84 GHz. The authors should include co-pol and cross-pol patterns at 44.74 GHz and 84.84 GHz in the paper.

In Table III, when substrate height = 1.72 mm, Gain = 7.81459 dBi and Directivity = 7.81427 dBi. According to the definition of Gain, the value of gain will be smaller than that of directivity. The authors should check this issue.

The return loss is misused with reflection coefficient. Please remember that the loss is always positive, negative loss mean gain, which is not the case here.

OWC has a major drawback of not having the proper light source that can be used for modulation. Persisting light sources do not have the flexibility for implementation of complex modulation processes. These are now replaced by more efficient and mobile source like light emitting diode (LED). LEDs can be used for data transmission in small distances which can be increased using the proper lens. In this study, LED is used to build a communication system via visible light with simple modulation technique with Raspberry Pi which is known as visible light communication (VLC) system. And we believe that it is one of the first instances of VLC system using Raspberry Pi. This approach tends to find the simplest way to transmit data using a light source. Data transfer rate can be increased by using other modulation techniques and adding more levels to it. Hence, an initiative is taken to develop a better data transfer process with higher transmission speed (using Raspberry Pi). The transmission distance can be increased using more coherent light sources and efficient receiver.",0

The technical writing could have been elaborated, the the conclusion  the paer states that the main advancement was using a Raspberry-pi for the VLC system, but it wa not specified why or how is the Raspberry-pi better than the current hardware used to implement the technology. The question in the end still remained, why was the Raspberry-pi chosen to conduct the research.
Next, it is stated in section 3 that the whole process is designed in python programming, but then in 3A, the algorithms creared by other data scientists is referred to. There is no clarity in the paper that the authors programmed just the raspberry-pi or also wrote the algorithms and  test programs to verify the results.

Data scientists have invented many algorithms to shrink the file size. 
So, there is an interchange in position means, the second step of the process is conversion of files into bit-stream.
The main advencement of this work is the implemention of VLC system in a new way with Raspberry Pi which we believe is one of the introductory instance of such work.

However, according to the explanation in page 3, it seems that the authors manually set the attribute level. Need to make it clear.

",15.0,An Energy Efficient System to Provide Real-Time Location Tracking Without Using GPS,"real-time system, mobile application, GPS","Location information has become a vital part of a wide variety of mobile applications. Generally, built-in Global Positioning Service (GPS) feature is used in these mobile applications. It has been observed that, tracking real-time location of a mobile device continuously using GPS kills excessive battery life of the devices. The rate of power consumption for using GPS is very high in any mobile device. Besides, GPS does not provide indoor location accurately. To improve accurate location tracking in real-time, here we have introduced a low power location tracking system for any android mobile device. This paper intends to track a deviceâs real-time location without using GPS. Fused Location Provider API has been applied to acquire required quality of service. This system works in any distant area. It has been tested in both indoor and outdoor locations with a wide range of distances. Remarkable accuracy has been observed in both scenarios. Moreover, significant savings of battery life has also been identified.",0

Furthermore, the entire dataset was splitted into 80% of training example and 20% of test example. After that, the training examples were passed through a set of machine learning frameworks which consist of âNearest Neighborsâ, âLinear SVMâ, âRBF SVMâ, âGaussian Processâ, âDecision Treeâ, âRandom Forestâ, âNeural Netâ, âAdaBoostâ, âNaive Bayesâ and âQDAâ algorithms.

In abstract, correct the sentence: “This research work proposes a method to find the most effective IMF by PCA based Hilber-Hong transformation.” – this work is not proposing a method for IMF selection rather it is presenting an investigation to identify the most significant IMF. Here, “Hilber-Hong” is misspelled and should be removed as you did not use the Hilbert-Huang transform. You have only showed the application of EMD.
In abstract, it is mentioned “Significant features are extracted from the signals and….” – please provide the justification/ reference why you consider the features as significant.
It should be clearly justified why two classifiers are included in this investigation and the reasons behind choosing the ANN and the LDA.
For easy understanding of the methodology, please provide a block diagram in Section III, at the beginning.
In Section III.A, you should discuss more clearly how channels C3, Cz, and C4 are combined into one signal.
Please provide reference of EMD process in Section III.B. As EMD is a well-established method, there is no need of describing the sifting process.
Please revise Eq. (5) to (9) – you have represented IMF number by ‘i’ but in the equation ‘i’ is used for representing sampling points. Please use a separate symbol, e.g., ‘k’ to represent the sampling points in these equations.
Please discuss the cross-validation scheme more clearly – mention size of total samples, training and testing set for each classifier.
In Table I and II, please highlight the highest accuracy value obtained for each IMF.
It is mentioned in Section IV “We found that the classification accuracy of IMF 4 reaches up to 92% where LDA outperforms the ANN.” – please revise this statement because according to Table I, II and Fig. 7, maximum accuracy obtained for IMF 4 is 95% for ANN (Table I, Subject 6 and IMF 4).
In Section V, to improve clarity, please revise the sentence “An algorithm for optimization of the EMD method by finding the most effective IMF maybe developed in future” as “In future, an IMF selection algorithm can be developed to identify the most effective IMFs after the EMD process”.
Please check and correct all the typos and grammatical errors.

However, the sample size of 8 patients is very small and doesn't have enough information to generalize the results. It is advised to increase the number of patients as ANN requires quite a big number of data for training. However, it might help as a pilot study for a bigger sample. 
State the percentage of the training set and the test set for the ANN classification.
State the mean value and the S-number criterion in the signal decomposition procedure.
It is not clear in the results section in Table I and Table II what are the features that were used for the detection accuracy comparison.
In the Bar chart provided in Fig 7. The ANN has a better detection accuracy than the LDA. While in the discussion it was stated that LDA outperforms ANN. A revision of the figure legend is to be done.
The max classification accuracy for IMF 4 using LDA classifiers 97% while it was stated as only 92%.  A revision should be done. 
Since the bar chart represents the mean accuracy of both classifiers it is advised to add the average for all 8 test subjects in both Table I and Table II.

Scrum, Kanban, and XP frameworks manage and deal with the advancement of Software Development. These frameworks are utilized in various circumstances and work processes. Subsequently, they are compelling for various Agile collaborators and tasks in different circumstances. However, the utilization of a wrong approach or practice prompts Software Development forms that are unbendable and inefficient, affecting the association and causing wasteful advancement. Adopters of Scrum, Kanban, and XP trust that the wrong practices of these frameworks are hazardous and in this manner, Agile workmates ought to be aided in their basic leadership. The point of this study is to decide the fundamental variables to consider amid the determination of Scrum, Kanban, and XP frameworks. The recognizable proof of the elements was directed through a top to bottom audit of the important work, after which, the content analysis was utilized in the investigation of information. As found, system recommendation, people, and tasks, adoption phase, team size, group size, requirements prioritizing, feature size, lead time, operational observes, budget, and quality were the primary aspects that guide Agile coworkers in preference Scrum or Kanban or XP and in accumulation their practices. This paper portrays a strategy to perform inspections on Agile approaches, in view of an arrangement of important highlights and characteristics.",1

2486,8981,"The paper presents a sEMG-based hand movement recognition scheme using SVM classifier. The paper used the dataset from Ref [26].  The paper is not generally well-written and need major improvement in light of the following comments:

Please modify the paper title – ‘RBF kernel’ need not to be mentioned in the title as it is just a property of SVM.
Please revise Section I for smooth flow of discussion. Introduce sEMG and then discuss only about the researches relevant to your work in a logical manner. Please avoid this type of sentence: “One research has focused on developing an artificial thumb which is claimed to be a challenging task.”- this is irrational as there are many such researches available in the literature. Towards the end of introduction (Section I), mention about the gap in literature that you are going to address or the objectives of your research and discuss in a justified manner how you are going to achieve them. Also, discuss about the structure of the paper.
1 (on first page) is difficult to understand. As you have mentioned that you obtained the dataset from ref [26], please replace this figure with Fig. 1 of ref [26] and cite ref [26] in the figure caption. Also, follow the hand movement sequence presented in ref [26] in figure captions and related discussions (i.e. throughout the paper).
In Table 1, provide the number of data acquisition channels.
1 is used twice. In the Fig. 1 (under ‘Signal pre-processing’ subsection), create a column on the left to provide name of the hand movements.
The Equation for waveform length (WL) should be corrected – ‘j-1’ should be replaced by ‘k=1’.
Please correct the equation for AR model – you have defined the subscript incorrectly.
Elaborate ‘RBF’ at the first instance.
While numbering the tables, Table 2 is skipped. Please fix the table numbering.
In Table 3, why each class has only 10 test samples? If the remaining samples (20) of each class are used for training the SVM, then this should be mentioned in the beginning of this section.
In Section V, correct the equation for accuracy: replace ‘Accuracy equation for confusion matrix’ by ‘Accuracy’ and express in % by multiplying 100.
The classification results and comparison (Fig.6 and Table 6) are not convincing. The authors should present classification results for combined feature, i.e. combining MAV, AR and WL into one feature vector as they have complementary capability in class separation. Did the authors perform classification with the other classifiers (KNN, random Forest, Naïve Bayes) themselves or collected the results from the literature? For this type of comparison, the sample database should be the same. The critical parameters related to the classifiers should be mentioned clearly.
Please revise Section VI (conclusion). It is mentioned “Recording more data from more people would increase the accuracy a bit more.” – explain how the accuracy can be improved while you are treating each subject individually.
There are lot of formatting and grammatical errors. Please check and correct all of them. For correction, some suggestions are provided here:

“For prosthetic arm design their pattern recognition is necessitated.” Should be corrected as “For prosthetic arm design, their pattern recognition is necessary.”
“Each trial contains 3000 points of signal” should be corrected as “Each signal contains 3000 time samples”
“SVM rbf kernel has been chosen as classifier” should be corrected as “SVM with RBF kernel has been chosen as classifier”

Add equation numbers to all equations in the manuscript for easier tracing.
Define the variables of all equations respectively as not all parameters are introduced well
The equation representing AR feature has an error in the summation index. n is not used within the equation, and the use of p is not clear (i-1 instead of p).
Use the same legends key symbols in all the figures (if possible) for simpler visual comparison.
All the acronyms should be used in the same way along the context (RFB not rfb). Once the acronym is defined the full term is not to be used again. 
The constrain in the second equation of SVM that represents the negative result y=-1 should be exactly less than 1 not ≤1.
The linear kernel function and the RFB kernel are to be rewritten clearly.
Caption format is to be revised for Table 1, 3, and 6.
There is no Table 2.
The table presents the results of only 10 measurements while it was stated that the experiment was repeated 30 times.
What kind of statistical test is used for testing the significance of the difference.
Why is it clear that MAV is more informative while the study is about the accurate detection?
The results of KNN, SVM linear kernel, Random forest, and naive bayes are not provided for comparison. If the results are taken from the original research that provided the dataset refer to that in the discussion.

Title of the paper: Experimental Studies on the Synthesis and Characterization of Gold Nanoparticles
The article demonstrated the experimental studies on the synthesis and characterization of gold nanoparticles via chemical reduction method. Gold naoparticles (GNPs) shows various shapes and sizes and has important physical properties which may use in the treatment of cancer or tumor cells and also many other fields such as electronics, photonics etc. However, there are some fundamental issues and suggestions that need to be addressed before this work can be accepted for publication.

In the introduction section, the author just mentioned definition of nanoparticles and various practical applications of GNPs. They should clearly mention the novelty of their work with respect to many other in the field.
For calculating/ measuring the size of a particle, usually XRD or EDX is used. But the author was measured the size of the particle from the absorption spectra. Some references should be used.
The color of the GNP solution was changed with amount of citrate. A clear explanation could be appreciated.
Some grammatical mistakes were found in the text. As an example, in the abstract, the author was written ‘Ultraviolet-Visible light spectroscopy was used characterize the produced gold nanoparticles’.
More focused results and discussion should be presented.
Previous works on the fabrication of nanoparticles are also evident in Bangladesh [19, 20]. The above sentence should be rearranged in the following : Previous works on the fabrication of nanoparticles are also evident elsewhere [19, 20].

Initially, background model is created for every pixel from the first frame. The sample values for the model of a pixel are collected from the neighborhood of that pixel. Then the new pixel values from the new frames are compared to make background foreground decision. Conventional background modeling faces problem with change in the illumination of the scene. The proposed method frequently checks whether abrupt change of illumination take place or not and then initialize the background model from the frame that is detected with changed illumination. The illumination change is detected by obtaining the images of two frames that are taken at a suitable interval, in HSV color space. Then the mean change in the value of each channel is calculated to make a decision. This enables the background model to start over with new sample values that are obtained in the current illumination condition and the background subtraction process can successfully detect moving object with accuracy even in changing illumination condition.
